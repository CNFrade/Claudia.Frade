                            <p > Mo:Dem Festival (short for Momento Demento) is a psychedelic trance festival, best known for its focus on Dark Psy and Forest Psytrance, promotes underground sounds, cutting edge visual and experimental art.
                            The festival is set in an idyllic location, an area surrounded by tall trees and crystal-clear water, near Mjesto Primišlje in Croatia. 
                            Visitors can not only expect the best lineup possible, but also other diverse musical content, innovative art installations (featuring original and innovative psychedelic sounds, and cutting edge experimental and visual art), as well as all sorts of transformative experiences (like workshops, discussions, or group activities).6
                            Striving forward, learning, self-improving and always pushing the boundaries of technical production is what makes Mo:Dem the unforgettable psychedelic experience. 
                            The festival’s politics is not about expanding each edition but investing in quality.
                            As if in an infinite loop, the work at Mo:Dem Festival never stops. Immediately after the end of one edition, the crew starts working on the next one. While the field team prepar the location for the first snow, carpenters prepars wood and construction for spring.
                            Meanwhile, the music selectors finalised the lineup, so they can announce the list of the performers for The Hive, The Swamp and The Seed.
                            Mo:Dem Festival is planned, prepared and built by dedicated and passionate work of our crew, workers and volunteers. Your friendship, support and comradeship was also a key ingredient. Massive respect goes to all of our visitors, ticket holders, artists, vendors, restaurants, shops, crowdfunding backers, promoters, friends and family.
                            HVALA!</p>

                        <p >There is a place where shade reigns even in the hottest temperatures, where you see moving pictures while sober, where relaxation is a state of mind and where no one will blame you if you fall asleep in the middle of the program (that is, if you don’t snore loudly).
                
                        If you want to relax during the seven days of Mo:Dem Festival, you need to visit and feel the chill vibes from Mo:Dem Experimental Cinema.

                        <p>Talking about art at Mo:Dem Festival seems redundant when each of its three stages is a work of art. Nevertheless, showcasing and promoting talented artists was integral part of festival from the day one. Since we opened our cultural corner Spirallabs, it became base for our art gallery curated by Collider Art.
                            The biggest novelty for this year is opening of HIVE VISIONS, an Art Gallery and Shop curated by a collective involved in the Mo:Dem Festival’s HIVE dancefloor, Stargate stage, Visuals and LED installations. Artists involved in the project are responsible for most unique psychedelic audio-visual experiences in the Milky Way and beyond. A dream come true for many Modemheads out there…
                        
                            HIVE VISIONS is based both in virtual space and Mo:Dem Festival location. Gallery is located in the new Chai Shop Area, right opposite of the Hive bar. Online shop will be operational from October 2022.
                        
                            HIVE VISIONS FEATURING:
                            BJÖRN JELINEK | AMYRA AHORA | ROBERT RUPPITSCH | ANKITA TRIVEDI | GERHARD | MIKE DUTKOWSKI | TAS VISUALS

                        <p> One of our visions that turned into reality is definitely Hive Visions, a platform for presenting and promoting talented Mo:Dem artists who participate in the creation of the Festival. After the last edition, where it was opened as a gallery and shop, from this autumn Hive Visions is present online: Hive Visions

                        Featured artists involved in the Hive Visions project are responsible for one of the most unique psychedelic audio-visual experiences on the planet Earth. All featured art is curated and produced by a collective involved in The Hive dancefloor, Stargate stage, Visuals and LED installations: Björn Jelinek, Amyra Ahora, Robert Ruppitsch and Ankita Trivedi.</p>
